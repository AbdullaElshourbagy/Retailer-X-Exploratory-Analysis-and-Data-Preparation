# Retailer-X-Exploratory-Analysis-and-Data-Preparation Project Introduction

Explore and Define the Retailer X data.  exploratory analysis and do the necessary data preparations before creating predictive models.

Retailer X is boutique retailer with only one physical location. They believe that their niche in the market is attributable to their unique flair of affordable, everyday items, including health and beauty, electronics, specialty treats, and apparel.

Their marketing is mostly word-of-mouth and a “surprise value” coupon that is sent to loyalty members, and an occasional coupon that is offered in support of local school fundraising efforts.

The retailer has interest in growing and potentially selling their products through new channels and is looking for some direction for an expansion strategy. They heard about analytics and want to see what it can do for them.

After facilitating a workshop with the client (Retailer X), you understand that they want to know who their customers are, and how to reach the right customers through targeted messaging:

They want to know what factors are associated with increased levels of spending in their stores.
They want to know what drives participation in their coupon and loyalty programs.
You learn that Retailer X recently conducted some customer research around customer satisfaction and discovered the following information:

They were shocked to learn that poorer than expected store experience scores were driven by the stores’ failure to have the appropriate amounts of stock on the shelves to meet the demands of their customers.
They want to ensure that if they expand and experience increased demand for their products that they have the appropriate amount of stock on hand each day.
It is time to look through the data dictionary, open the dictionary file in Excel format, and think about the following questions:

Based on your business understanding (documented previously), do you have the data that you need to answer the client’s questions?
What relationships in the data do you want to explore?
What extra fields do you think that you might need that you might be able to derive?
Here are the main Python packages that you are going to use in the code:

NumPy (Numerical Python) is a linear algebra library in Python. It is an important library on which almost every data science or machine learning Python package, such as SciPy (Scientific Python), Mat−plotlib (plotting library), and Scikit-learn, depends.

Pandas is a Python package that provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures that are designed to make working with “relational” or “labeled” data both easy and intuitive. It is based on NumPy.

Matplotlib is a Python plotting library. It is used to generate plots, histograms, bar charts, scatterplots, and other metrics with a few lines of code.

Scikit-learn is the popular Python machine learning library. It is built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib. With Scikit-learn, you can build classification, regression, and clustering models and do other data preparation tasks.
